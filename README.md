Large Integer Operations
Overview

The Large Integer Operations program is a Python script that allows users to perform arithmetic operations on a large integer. The user can choose to divide the integer by either 2 or 3, or to calculate its modulus with 9. This program demonstrates basic input handling, arithmetic operations, and the use of pattern matching in Python.
Features

    Displays a predefined large integer.
    Offers the user a selection of arithmetic operations.
    Uses pattern matching to perform the selected operation.
    Outputs the result of the operation.

Usage
